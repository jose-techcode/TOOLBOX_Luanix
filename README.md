# 1. TOOLBOX Luanix

The "TOOLBOX Luanix" is a toolbox that automates backup of files, file organization, system cleanup, tool installation, and log auditing tasks. Packaging these scripts in .deb is not recommended, as they are intended solely for the Debian operating system, and due to their complexity. The shell scripting language used was bash. If you want, you can schedule some scripts with cron, using crontab -e in terminal. Nano editor is recommended for cron.

# 2. Permissions (cd scripts)

- `chmod +x audit_logs.sh`

- `chmod +x files_backup.sh`

- `chmod +x files_organization.sh`

- `chmod +x update_clean.sh`

- `chmod +x update_install.sh`

- (project root) `chmod +x docker_trivy.sh`

# 2.1. Features (cd scripts)

- `sudo ./audit_logs.sh` - Audit of system log and authentication log.

- `./files_backup.sh` - Backup files from the documents, music, pictures, videos and downloads
directories.

- `./files_organization.sh` - Organizing file extensions into their respective directories.

- `sudo ./update_clean.sh` - Update and upgrade packages, remove orphaned dependencies and clean old packages.

- `sudo ./update_install.sh` - Update, upgrade and installs packages.

- (project root) `./docker_trivy.sh` - Build a Docker image and scan it with Trivy.

# 2.2. Makefile features (project root)

- `sudo make logs` - Audit of system log and authentication log.

- `make backup` - Backup files from the documents, music, pictures, videos and downloads
directories.

- `make organization` - Organizing file extensions into their respective directories.

- `sudo make clean` - Update and upgrade packages, remove orphaned dependencies and clean old packages.

- `sudo make install` - Update, upgrade and installs packages.

- `make image` - Build a Docker image and scan it with Trivy.

# 2.3. Ansible features (cd ansible)

- `ansible-playbook playbook_sudo.yml --ask-become-pass` - Update, upgrade and install packages, remove orphaned dependencies and clean old packages.

- `ansible-playbook playbook_user.yml` - Organization of files by extensions and backup of files of main directories.

# 2.4. Cron guide

- Open the cron file

`crontab -e`

- Add scripts that can be scheduled, like the ones below (with &&)

`0 12 * * * /full/path/to/update_clean.sh && /full/path/to/files_organization.sh && /full/path/to/files_backup.sh`

- **Note:**

After adding the scripts, press CTRL + O + Enter to save and CTRL + X to exit. The scripts shown above will run at noon, so make sure you know how to set up cron scheduling.

# 4. Clone the Repository

- Bash

`git clone https://github.com/jose-techcode/TOOLBOX_Luanix`

# 5. Project Folder

- Bash

`cd TOOLBOX_Luanix`

# 5.1. Scripts Folder

- Bash

`cd scripts`

# 5.2. Ansible Folder

- Bash

`cd ansible`

# 5.3. Terraform Folder

- Bash

`cd terraform`

# 6. Run in Docker (experimental)

- Build the image

`docker build -t toolbox_luanix .`

- Scan the Docker image with Trivy (false positives are expected)

`trivy image toolbox_luanix:latest`

- Run the image with privileges

`docker run --rm --privileged toolbox_luanix:latest`

# 6.1. Run in Docker (experimental with Bash)

- Execute this script to build Docker image and scan with Trivy

`./docker_trivy.sh`

- Run the image with privileges

`docker run --rm --privileged toolbox_luanix:latest`

# 6.2. Run in Docker (experimental with Makefile)

- Execute this makefile command to build Docker image and scan with Trivy

`make image`

- Run the image with privileges

`docker run --rm --privileged toolbox_luanix:latest`

# 7. Terraform features (cd terraform)

- `terraform init` (optional: -upgrade) - Start the project directory.

- `terraform plan` - Show what terraform will create, change, and destroy.

- `terraform apply` (optional: -auto-approve) - Applies infrastructure provisioning (container).

- `terraform destroy` (optional: -auto-approve) - Destroy infrastrcture (container).

- `terraform fmt` - Formats the organization of .tf files.

- `terraform validate` - Check if the terraform configuration is correct.

- `terraform show` - Show the status of infrastructure.

- `terraform graph` - Show the dependency graph.

- **Note:** 

There are other Terraform commands, but they are not yet applicable to this project. Terraform in this project is more for learning purposes, as the docker_trivy.sh script with makefile solves much of the problem proposed to be solved by Terraform in relation to Docker. Terraform to provision local virtual machine is not recommended depending on your case.

# 10. Notes

This scripting toolbox is intended exclusively for the Debian operating system. It is not guaranteed to work on other linux distros without adaptation. It is not recommended to use Docker for some scripts, given the dependence on the operating system for the correct functioning of the automations. But, you can use some scripts experimentally in Docker. Much of this project is for learning purposes. Finished.
